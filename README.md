## Weekly study 1:
This week we started constructing a website and learning about Joomla CMS, in practice 1 I created a web page and uploaded it on github. This created a lot of trouble, including problems with the structure of the HTML code and uploading the HTML to Github. But I got a lot of help in the Github forums to get me through this part. In the next I will try with the video and other related materials about Joomla CMS.

## Weekly study 2:

This week, we covered some aspects of Joomla and WordPress. Honestly, I found the explanations in class and the provided materials quite confusing. In short, I had no clue about hands-on operations with Joomla and WordPress. Consequently, I opted to explore related knowledge on YouTube and forums to gain a better understanding of using Joomla and WordPress.

Joomla posed some challenges for me, especially regarding whether I could use templates downloaded from the internet for the assignments. This led me to spend a significant amount of time in the template-building stage. While the outcome was not entirely satisfactory, only achieving basic functionality, I did gain valuable knowledge and experience with Joomla-related languages. I referred to resources like the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-7jsURjLiU (though it was not very helpful due to outdated versions) and other official tutorials (too numerous to list here), which provided some assistance.

In the end, I managed to replicate a part of a webpage using HTML code (although I struggled with reproducing colors due to my unfamiliarity with template design). Nonetheless, it runs and can be browsed. I believe there is a need for continuous learning in the future and preparation for potential group activities (even though I feel that I might not contribute significantly to a group).

## Weekly study 3:

This week we tried to construct a website using WordPress that is the same as the original joomla (or a new attempt). After I watched the study material, I realized that WordPress is better than joomla in terms of ease of use, modifiability, functionality, and most of all, for example, some of the components in joomla are very difficult to import and there are some problems with some of the add-one links. But these in WordPress do not exist. I've built a much better looking web page with WordPress in about a third of the time. In short, WordPress is almost 90% identical to joomla and I didn't need to do very much extra learning. Also its more convenient for me to edit a web page. Meanwhile, this week I found my team members and we will start working together in the next few days.

## Weekly study 4:
This week, I deployed a site on my localhost that contains a DB database (test). At the same time I also built wordpress. this is not much different from building it in an online program, the main difficulty is configuring the localhost.
