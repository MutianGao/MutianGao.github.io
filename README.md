## Weekly study:
This week we started constructing a website and learning about Joomla CMS, in practice 1 I created a web page and uploaded it on github. This created a lot of trouble, including problems with the structure of the HTML code and uploading the HTML to Github. But I got a lot of help in the Github forums to get me through this part. In the next I will try with the video and other related materials about Joomla CMS.
